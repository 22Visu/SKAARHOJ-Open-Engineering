The SKAARHOJ.lbr eagle library can be included in EAGLE by:
- opening EAGLE
- Chose the menu Options > Directories >
- For “Libraries”, add the path to the SKAARHOJ library with a semicolon, for instance “$EAGLEDIR/lbr:/Path-to-directory/Eagle” where “Eagle” is the directory in which you store the SKAARHOJ.lbr file.
